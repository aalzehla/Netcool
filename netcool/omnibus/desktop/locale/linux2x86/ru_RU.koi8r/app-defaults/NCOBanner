! HPUX11/HPUX 10.20 work-arounds. Due to the default font set specifications
! used by CDE, the HPUX library is unable to convert the font set due to
! missing charsets. This should be OK, but on HPUX 11 our application will
! crash in the widget creation as the application has no fonts. This is not
! good. We override these resources here in order to prevent this error 
! from occurring. :)
