<h1 class="title topictitle1">Configuring accelerated event notification</h1>
<div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">You can configure <span class="keyword">Tivoli Netcool/OMNIbus</span> for
accelerated event notification of events that could present a risk
to the system. The Accelerated Event Notification (AEN) system provides
a means of accelerating high-priority events to help ensure that systems
can continue to run without interruption. </p>
<div class="p">When configuring accelerated event notification, use the following
guidelines:<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Determine the conditions under which you want to accelerate events.
Consider whether to use the probe rules file to flag events for acceleration,
or whether to set up conditions within a post-insert, post-update,
or post-reinsert trigger in the ObjectServer. <p class="p">If the conditions
under which events should be accelerated are set up in the rules file,
and are complex, you might need to configure the alerts.status table
with a dedicated column to receive a flag that identifies an event
as an accelerated event.</p>
<p class="p">Typically, you can run a post-insert
trigger on inserted events to determine whether they meet the conditions
for acceleration, or run a post-update trigger on updated events that
have been enriched with information from other sources, or run a post-reinsert
trigger to escalate repeating events.</p>
</li>
<li class="li">Determine whether you require a dedicated gateway for forwarding
accelerated events. Consider the use of a dedicated gateway if you
want to eliminate the possibility of unexpected delays caused by high
volumes of events, which may largely be non-critical, or if you want
to send accelerated events to a different ObjectServer than that used
for normal IDUC updates. If using a dedicated gateway, you must configure
that gateway to replicate only accelerated inserts and updates.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="p">You also need to use Netcool/OMNIbus Administrator to
configure accelerated event notification, as follows:<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Set up a dedicated event column to flag an event for acceleration,
if required.</li>
<li class="li">Set up channels to define the type of event data to be included
in accelerated event notifications, and the recipients of this event
data.</li>
<li class="li">Configure post-insert, post-update, or post-reinsert triggers
to act on accelerated events that are inserted or updated in the alerts.status
table.</li>
</ul>

<li class="link ulchildlink"><span class="ulchildlinktext"><a href="omn_adm_aen_configuringchannels.html">Configuring channels to broadcast event data</a></span><br />
When configuring accelerated event notification, you must
use channels to define the type of event data to broadcast in the
accelerated event notifications, and the recipients of this data.
You can set up multiple channels with varied event data and recipients.</li>
</ul>
