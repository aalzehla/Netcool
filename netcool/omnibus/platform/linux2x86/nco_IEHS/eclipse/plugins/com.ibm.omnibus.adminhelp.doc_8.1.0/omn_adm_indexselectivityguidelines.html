<h1 class="title topictitle1">How to use selectivity as a guideline for indexing table columns</h1>
<div class="body refbody"><p class="shortdesc">The index selectivity is not the only criterion for deciding
whether a table column makes an effective index. Also consider the
types of queries that you want to run against the index. Use these
examples to help you decide which table columns to index.</p>
<div class="section">The following examples show where an index can have an initial
high or low selectivity rating, but also show how the choice of whether
to create an index is affected by the type of query being used to
access the table.</div>
<div class="example"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Example 1</h2><p class="p">The following example would return
a high selectivity rating: A table with 30000 rows, with column (A)
containing values of between 1 and 15000, where none of the values
occur more than twice.</p>
<p class="p">Note how the usage of queries against
the index can determine the effectiveness of the index.</p>
<p class="p">For
example, if the following WHERE clause is used in a query to access
the rows of the table, the result is a high selectivity rating and
the query makes good use of the index:</p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>where A = 5 or A = 10</code></pre>
<p class="p">However,
if the following WHERE clause is used to access the rows in the table,
only two rows from the 30000 rows would be ignored by the index. This
would therefore be a poor candidate for an index.</p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>where A &gt; 1</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="example"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Example 2</h2><p class="p">The following example would return
a low selectivity rating: A table with 20000 rows, with column (B)
containing values of either 1 or 2.</p>
<p class="p">Note how the usage of queries
against the index can determine the effectiveness of the index.</p>
<p class="p">For
example, if the following WHERE clause is used to access the rows
in the table, all values are matched, and so there is no benefit from
creating an index.</p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>where B = 1 or B = 2</code></pre>
<p class="p">However,
if the following WHERE clause is used to access the rows in the table,
the effectiveness of the index depends on the distribution of the
value 1:</p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>where B = 1</code></pre>
<p class="p">The factors for determining
the effectiveness of an index are as follows:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">If there are few instances of the value 1, an index would reduce
the number of rows being processed, and would therefore be a good
candidate for an index.</li>
<li class="li">If the majority of rows contain the value 1, an indexed column
would not provide any benefit.</li>
<li class="li">If there is an equal distribution of the two values, an index
would reduce the number of rows being processed by 50%. The table
would therefore be a good candidate for an index.</li>
</ul>
