a privileged user.</p>
<div class="section context"><div class="tasklabel"><h2 class="sectiontitle tasklabel">About this task</h2></div><p class="p">There are instances when the process agent must be run
as a privileged user. For example, when running the SNMP Probe which
needs to open port 162, or when local file authentication is in use
and the process agent must be able to read the <span class="ph filepath">/etc/shadow</span> file
to authenticate users (UNIX only).</p>
<p class="p">To
set up a process agent to run as a privileged user:</p>
</div>
<div class="tasklabel"><h2 class="sectiontitle tasklabel">Procedure</h2></div><ol class="ol steps"><li class="li step stepexpand"><span class="ph cmd">Install and run the primary process agent as a privileged
user, and configure it to run on the host machine using the start-up
script (UNIX) or using a service
(Windows).</span></li>
<li class="li step stepexpand"><span class="ph cmd">Run a secondary process agent as a non-privileged user,
and configure it to execute external ObjectServer actions. You must
also configure it to run in non-daemon mode, as a child process of
the primary process agent. Therefore, you must create an additional
process entry in your primary process agent configuration file, as
shown in the following example:</span> <pre class="pre codeblock"><code>nco_process 'NON_ROOT_PA'
{
Command '$OMNIHOME/bin/nco_pad -name NON_ROOT_PA -nodaemon -configfile 
$OMNIHOME/etc/NON_ROOT_PA.conf' run as 1000
Host = 'hostx'
Managed = True
RestartMsg = '${NAME} running as ${EUID} has been restored on ${HOST}.'
AlertMsg = '${NAME} running as ${EUID} has died on ${HOST}.'
RetryCount = 0
ProcessType = PaPA_AWARE
}</code></pre>
<div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Additional notes:</span> </div>
 <ul class="ul"><li class="li">In the previous example, the secondary process agent is set to
start as user <samp class="ph tt">1000</samp> (UID). It is also set to start with the <samp class="ph codeph">-nodaemon</samp> start-up
switch. This prevents it from forking to a child process, and allows
it to be managed by the primary process agent.</li>
<li class="li">You must define a configuration file for the secondary process
agent. The permissions for the configuration file must enable it to
be accessed by the user account that is running the secondary process
agent.</li>
<li class="li">You must modify the properties file associated with the ObjectServer
which is currently running as a process under the primary process
agent. This includes setting the following properties: <span class="keyword parmname parmname">PA.Name</span>, <span class="keyword parmname parmname">PA.Username</span>,
and <span class="keyword parmname parmname">PA.Password</span>.</li>

For example, as the root user (UNIX) or as the Local System User (Windows). This presents a potential security risk. Therefore, the process agent must be run as a non-privileged user.">Process agent security considerations</a></div>
