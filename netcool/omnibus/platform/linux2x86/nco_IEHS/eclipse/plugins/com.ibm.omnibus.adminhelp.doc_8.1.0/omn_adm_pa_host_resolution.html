<h1 class="title topictitle1">Host name resolution at startup</h1>
<div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">Every external automation or process under the control
of a process agent must have a specified host. The host is defined
either in the process agent configuration file, as part of a process
definition, or in the external automation in the ObjectServer.</p>
<div class="section"><p class="p">The default process agent configuration file is <span class="ph filepath">$NCHOME/omnibus/etc/nco_pa.conf</span>.</p>
<p class="p">The
process agent can handle host names and addresses that are specified
in different formats. This is necessary because the host details are
often extracted from data elements in an event or alert. Depending
on the source of the alert, a host might be specified as an IP address
or a host name, or in some other format.</p>
<p class="p">At startup, the process
agent builds an internal list of all the local host's network interfaces,
resolving the name of each network interface that it finds. This list
enables the process agent to map a given host to any number of valid
local interface host names. For example, the default host name on
a machine might be <span class="q">"testbox"</span> but a request might be sent to the
process agent asking for a process to be run on <span class="q">"testbox.company.com"</span>,
or the request might specify the IPv4 or IPv6 address of the host.
In each case, the process agent must recognize that the host referred
to is the host that the process is running on.</p>
<p class="p">If host name
resolution (using DNS or Active Directory, for example) is slow or
is not available, the process agent might be slow to start because
it must wait for a timeout to occur on all the host names that cannot
be resolved. Also, any later process request that uses an unknown
host name will not be run. Where a process is configured to start
as a Windows service, and problems with DNS resolution cause it to
start slowly, the service can timeout on startup. All such failures
are logged. System administrators can use this information to fix
any network configuration issues on affected hosts.</p>
