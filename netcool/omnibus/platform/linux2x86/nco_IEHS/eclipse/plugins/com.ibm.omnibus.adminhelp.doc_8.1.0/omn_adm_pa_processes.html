<div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">Processes are programs that are run by a process agent
on the same workstation, within a process control system. Processes
must be defined in a <dfn class="term">service</dfn>, for ease of management. </p>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Process control awareness</h2><p class="p">A <dfn class="term">PA aware</dfn> process
is one that is part of the process control configuration and is aware
of process control. All process control features, such as process
dependencies, can be used. For example, ObjectServers, proxy servers,
and ObjectServer gateways are PA aware. A process that is not PA aware
can be managed by process control, but cannot use all process control
features. For example, the <span class="keyword">Tivoli Netcool/OMNIbus</span> desktop
is not PA aware.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Dependent processes</h2><p class="p">The order in which applications
are started can be important. You can use process control to configure
processes to be dependent on each other <em class="ph i">if they are in the same
service</em>. For example, a process can be configured to start only
after another process has started and completed various startup tasks.</p>
<p class="p">A
PA aware process communicates with the process agent. When the process
reaches the point in its startup where it recognizes itself to be
running, it sends a message to the process agent. When the process
agent receives this message, it starts dependent processes.</p>
