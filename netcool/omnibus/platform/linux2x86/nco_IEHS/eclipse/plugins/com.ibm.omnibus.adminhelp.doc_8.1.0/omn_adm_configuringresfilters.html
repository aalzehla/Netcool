<h1 class="title topictitle1">Configuring restriction filters</h1>
<div class="body conbody"><div class="abstract"><div class="shortdesc">You can use restriction filters to control the
rows in ObjectServer tables that users are allowed to view and modify.
Restriction filters apply to <span class="keyword">Tivoli Netcool/OMNIbus</span> client applications and INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE statements.
You can assign restrictions filters to individual users or to a collection
of users in a group.</div>
<p class="p">You can assign only one restriction
filter per table to a user or a group. However, multiple restriction
filters can apply to a user. For example, a user can be assigned a
single restriction filter and can also be a member of one or more
groups, to which restriction filters are applied. So, if a user is
a member of three groups to which restriction filters are assigned,
and the user is also assigned a restriction filter, four restriction
filters apply to that user. If multiple restriction filters apply
to a user, the resulting data is a combination of all applicable restriction
filters for the user or group</p>
<p class="p"><span class="ph">If you are using multiple
restriction filters, make sure that you set the ObjectServer <span class="keyword parmname parmname">RestrictionFiltersAND</span> property
appropriately.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="example">You create a restriction filter against the alerts.status
table that has the following condition:<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>Tally &gt; 100 AND Severity &gt; 4</code></pre>
After this restriction filter is applied to a user, the user can
see only events that occurred more than 100 times and that have a
severity that is greater than 4.</div>
<div class="example"><p class="p">Another example usage of restriction filters is to limit
the geographical coverage for events that users can view. You can
create a restriction filter against the alerts.status table that permits
London-based users to view only events from operations centers in
London.</p>
