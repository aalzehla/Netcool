<div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">When configuring accelerated event notification, you must
use channels to define the type of event data to broadcast in the
accelerated event notifications, and the recipients of this data.
You can set up multiple channels with varied event data and recipients.</p>
<p class="p">Channel administration is permitted only for users with the ChannelAdmin
role. </p>
<p class="p">The event data for channels is derived from columns in the ObjectServer
tables. </p>
<div class="note tip"><span class="tiptitle">Tip:</span> The columns that you choose for a channel should
contain sufficient summary data to help operators interpret critical
issues at first glance, when such issues are forwarded to the screen
as pop-up notifiers. Operators can then click across to the desktop
event list or the <span class="keyword">Web GUI</span> Active
Event List to obtain full details for the event and to manage the
event.</div>
<p class="p">Note that click-across functionality from a pop-up notifier to
the event list or the Active Event List is available only for events
in the alerts.status table.</p>

If you need to perform minor maintenance on the ObjectServer,

the Accelerated Event Notification clients that are currently running.
As part of the disconnect action, you can enter a brief message to
users with relevant information.</li>

If you need to shut down the ObjectServer, you can remotely

running. As part of shutting down, you can enter a brief message to
users with relevant information.</li>
