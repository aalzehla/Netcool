<h1 class="title topictitle1">How process agents connect</h1>
<div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">You can set up a process control network system by configuring
process control on several <span class="keyword">Tivoli Netcool/OMNIbus</span> hosts.</p>
<p class="p">The process agents can then communicate with each other and run
programs on request. Process agents running on Windows operating systems can communicate
with process agents running on UNIX operating
systems, and vice versa.</p>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Running process agents in a routing configuration</h2><p class="p">When
several process agents are connected by routing statements, each process
agent in the process control network can be made aware of processes
in the other process agents. A process agent configuration file is
used to define processes, services, and hosts in the process control
network, and to define routing statements.</p>
<p class="p">The process control
system supports full remote management of your process agents from
a single console. You can add, modify, delete, start, and stop services
and processes remotely. You can also view the status of both local
and remote processes. If using Netcool/OMNIbus Administrator to
manage process control, you can optionally save your changes to the
configuration files of the process agents. </p>
<div class="p">The process agents
support the dynamic addition of routing statements from Netcool/OMNIbus Administrator.
You can also add a new process agent to a routing group as follows:<ol class="ol"><li class="li">Copy and modify the current configuration from an existing process
agent to have visibility of the current processes.</li>
<li class="li">Update the configuration files for each of the other process agents
by adding the new routing entry to the routing definition area in
the files.</li>
<li class="li">Stop each of the existing process agents and their child processes
by running the <span class="keyword cmdname">nco_pa_shutdown</span> utility with the <span class="keyword option">-option
STOP</span> setting. Then restart each process agent in order to
pick up the new routing.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> Service and process names must be unique
within the process control network.</div>

Every external automation or process under the control
of a process agent must have a specified host. The host is defined
either in the process agent configuration file, as part of a process
definition, or in the external automation in the ObjectServer.</li>
