<h1 class="title topictitle1">Best practices for creating triggers</h1>
<div class="body refbody"><div class="abstract"><div class="shortdesc">When you create or modify triggers, ensure that
the triggers are as efficient as possible, and have the shortest possible
execution time.</div>
<p class="p">A trigger has exclusive access to the
ObjectServer database for the duration of its execution. By minimizing
the execution time of a trigger, you can free up time for other triggers
or clients that require access to the database. It is important to
reduce the execution of database triggers because they interrupt the
execution of a database operation, and so slow down the operation.
For example, a pre-insert trigger on the alerts.status table fires
for every new event. So, if an event flood occurs, the trigger is
executed multiple times.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><p class="p">The ObjectServer records the amount of time that each
trigger uses during each granularity period and saves the details
in the <span class="ph filepath">$NCHOME/omnibus/log/<var class="keyword varname">servername</var>_trigger_stats.log<var class="keyword varname">n</var></span> file.
Use this file to identify which triggers are using the most time,
prioritize which triggers to review, and monitor the system. In general,
review a trigger if it uses more than 3 seconds of time every 60 seconds
(that is, the default granularity period).</p>
<p class="p">Whenever you update
your triggers, review the log file to verify that your changes do
not cause a degradation in performance. </p>
<p class="p">Use the following guidelines
to improve the performance of your triggers. </p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Avoid table scans in database triggers</h2><p class="p">Table scans are expensive operations and can occur when
SQL statements such as FOR EACH ROW are applied to a database table.
In a database trigger, the cost of these scans is high if the trigger
fires frequently and if the table has a large number of rows. For
example, if you change the deduplication trigger on the alerts.status
table that every time the trigger fires it scans alerts.status for
rows matching a set of criteria. In this case, the scalability of
the system is limited, because the database trigger takes longer and
longer as the number of rows that need to be scanned increases. Also
avoid nested scans.</p>
<div class="p">You can use the following techniques to
avoid the table scan in database triggers: <ul class="ul"><li class="li">Perform the scan in a temporal trigger that is written so that
one scan can match many rows. See the generic_clear trigger in <span class="ph filepath">$NCHOME/omnibus/etc/automation.sql</span> for
an example.</li>
<li class="li">If using a lookup table to enrich events, access the lookup table
by using its primary key, as described further on. The use of the
primary key results in a direct lookup of the row rather than a scan
(V7.2, or later). You can also limit the size of the lookup table.
The number of rows that are acceptable for a lookup table is site-specific.
It also depends on factors such as how often the lookup table is accessed,
and hardware performance.</li>
<li class="li">Access a lookup table by using an index.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Avoid the EVALUATE clause</h2><p class="p">When a trigger
contains an EVALUATE clause, a temporary table is created to hold
the results of the SELECT statement in the EVALUATE clause. The amount
of time and resources that this temporary table consumes depends on
the number of columns that are selected and the number of rows matched
by the condition in the WHERE clause.</p>
<p class="p">In most cases, you can
replace the EVALUATE clause with a FOR EACH ROW clause. The FOR EACH
ROW clause reads over the data and does not incur the overhead of
creating a temporary table.</p>
<p class="p">A suitable use for an EVALUATE clause
is when a GROUP BY clause is being applied to an SQL query.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Avoid excessive use of the WRITE INTO statement for
logging out to file</h2><p class="p">When triggers is deployed in production
environments, comment out or remove WRITE INFO statements. It is advisable
to limit the use of WRITE INFO statements to development environments,
for debugging triggers. The quantity of data that is logged during
debugging might cause a bottleneck in production environments.</p>
<p class="p">Determine what is suitable for your system. For example,
if the logging is infrequently called, there is probably no issue.
However, if logging is called multiple times per INSERT statement
(for example, within a nested loop), there could be a bottleneck. </p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Where possible, use the primary key when modifying
rows</h2><p class="p">If the primary key of a database table is used in the
WHERE clause of an UPDATE statement, the row is accessed by using
direct lookup, rather than a table scan. For example:</p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>update alerts.status where Identifier = tt.Identifier set Severity = Severity + 1;</code></pre>
<div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> The VIA keyword is no longer required in V7.2, or later.
The following command (which uses VIA) is equivalent to the preceding
command:<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>update alerts.status VIA Identifier = tt.Identifier set Severity = Severity + 1;</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Use indexes when using lookup tables</h2><p class="p">In
V7.2, or later, the ObjectServer uses an index to access rows in a
table if the primary key is used in a FOR EACH ROW statement.</p>
<p class="p">This
functionality is most useful where an ObjectServer table is being
used as a lookup table, for example to enrich events. In such a case,
design the table and triggers to access the lookup table by its primary
keys, to prevent costly full table scans. For example:</p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>create table alerts.iplookup persistent
(
	IpAddr		varchar(32) primary key,
	HostName	varchar(8),
	Owner		varchar(40)
);

create or replace trigger set_hostname
group madeup_triggers
priority 10
before insert on alerts.status
for each row
begin
	-- Access the lookup table using the primary key
	for each row tt in alerts.iplookup where tt.IpAddr = new.Node
	begin
		set new.Hostname = tt.HostName;
	end;
end;</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Review and modify triggers produced from migrating
from V3.6</h2><div class="p">If you migrated from V3.6 to V7.2.1,
as part of an upgrade to the current version, the V7.2.1 migration
tool produces best-effort replications of the V3.6 triggers. When
you then upgrade to the current version, these are functionally correct,
but might not perform efficiently. Review and modify these triggers
as follows:<ul class="ul"><li class="li">The V3.6 ObjectServer supported only temporal triggers, while
V7.0 or later, includes database and signal triggers. The processing
that is performed by a temporal trigger in V3.6 might be better suited
to a database trigger in V7.0 or later. Because the triggers are converted
only on a like-for-like basis, identify which triggers can be better
implemented by using the new trigger types.</li>
<li class="li">Where V3.6 triggers have the condition <samp class="ph codeph">select *</samp>,
the migration tool implements the condition as an EVALUATE clause,
where all the columns in the alerts.status table are selected. Where
possible, replace the EVALUATE clause with a FOR EACH ROW statement. </li>
<li class="li">When migrating from V3.6, the migration tool also creates generic
clear triggers that work in the same manner as in V3.6. However, the
triggers supplied in V7.0, or later, are more efficient. Therefore,
it is advisable to use the V7.0 or later triggers, which are by default
disabled, instead of using the triggers migrated from V3.6.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Use the generic_clear trigger as a basis for correlation
type triggers</h2><p class="p">The standard generic_clear trigger (see <span class="ph filepath">$NCHOME/omnibus/etc/automation.sql</span>)
correlates resolution events with their related problem events. After
this trigger runs, all matched rows have their severity set to 0,
in readiness for removal by the delete_clears automation. If you need
different types of correlation trigger, base these triggers on the
generic_clear trigger.</p>
<p class="p">The standard generic_clear trigger does
not use the EVALUATE clause to select the events. Instead it uses
the FOR EACH ROW construct to loop over the events to populate a temporary
table with the problem events. Because this temporary table contains
only a subset of the events in the alerts.status table, the cost of
the update operation that is applied to relate the problems with resolutions
is reduced. Additionally, because the identifier of the problem event
is stored in the temporary table, the problem events can be updated
directly in alerts.status by using the UPDATE VIA command to perform
a direct lookup on the row; this takes advantage of the Identifier
field being a primary key.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Use deduplication to clear events where possible</h2><div class="p">The
deduplication trigger can be used to clear problem events with the
incoming resolution event when there is a one-to-one mapping between
the problem and resolution. The following modification is required
to your existing system:<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Write the probe rules so that the problem and resolution events
have the same identifier.</li>
<li class="li">Modify the deduplication trigger so that when it fires
it checks the Type field. If the type of the incoming event is set
to 2 (resolution), set the severity of the existing event to 0.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p class="p">This approach reduces the amount of processing for the
generic_clear trigger to perform. It leaves the trigger to resolve
cases where a single resolution event can clear many problem events.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Notes on creating automations</h2><div class="p">Use
the following best practice guidelines create new automations:<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Confirm whether an automation currently exists before attempting
to create new automations with the same function.</li>
<li class="li">In any WHERE conditions within the automation, use the guidelines
for reordering of predicates in SQL queries. For example, compare
integers, compare characters, and then compare regular expressions.
For more information, see <a class="xref" href="omn_adm_per_optimizationrules.html#omn_adm_per_optimizationrules" title="When SQL query optimization occurs, all of the optimization rules are applied to the condition in the query and then the predicates are reordered.">Optimization rules for SQL queries</a>.</li>
<li class="li">Ensure that the automation trigger does not acquire events which
were previously processed, especially in the case of external scripts.</li>
<li class="li">For temporal triggers, set the firing interval of different triggers
to prevent them from being activated together.</li>
<li class="li">Add a description to all newly created automations.</li>
<li class="li">Automations can update the journal entry if they modify events
in the ObjectServer database.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Test your changes</h2><div class="p">After new triggers are
developed and validated, test the performance of the triggers as follows:<ol class="ol"><li class="li">Ensure that the data on which you run the tests is representative
of the production system.</li>
<li class="li">Ensure that the number of rows in any table that the trigger accesses
is representative of the production system. </li>
<li class="li">Measure the effect on system performance by using profiling and
by collecting trigger statistics.</li>
</ol>
