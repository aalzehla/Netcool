<h1 class="title topictitle1">MIB object types</h1>
<div class="body refbody"><p class="shortdesc">This topic describes the object types defined in SNMP v1
and v2.</p>
<div class="section"><p class="p">You can locate the object information described in the
following sections by selecting a module in the <span class="keyword wintitle">MIB Modules</span> view
and then searching for <kbd class="ph userinput">ifIndex</kbd> in the <span class="ph uicontrol">Search</span> field
of the <span class="keyword wintitle">OID Tree</span> view. Click on the <samp class="ph codeph">ifIndex</samp> object
in the <span class="keyword wintitle">OID Tree</span> hierarchy to see object information
and textual convention information in the <span class="keyword wintitle">Details</span> view.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">OBJECT IDENTIFIER</h2><p class="p">The <samp class="ph codeph">OBJECT IDENTIFIER</samp> is
defined by SNMP v1 and is the main building block of the MIB tree.
Object identifiers are analogous to a chapter heading in a book -
they contain no real data but do give you an idea of what kind of
content is relayed by their descendents.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">OBJECT TYPE</h2><p class="p">The <samp class="ph codeph">OBJECT-TYPE</samp> is
defined by SNMP v1 and is used as a container for storing information
about the managed device, or some measured value on the device.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">TEXTUAL CONVENTION</h2><p class="p">The <samp class="ph codeph">TEXTUAL-CONVENTION</samp> (TC)
is a definition of a type of object but is not an actual object. In
the <span class="keyword wintitle">MIB Modules</span> view, you can select <span class="ph uicontrol">Textual
Conventions</span> from the <span class="ph uicontrol">View</span> list
to see the parsed textual conventions displayed in the MIB tree. Select
a TC name in the MIB tree to display its definition in the <span class="keyword wintitle">Details</span> view.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">SNMP v1 TRAP TYPE and SNMP v2 NOTIFICATION TYPE</h2><div class="p">The
SNMP v1 TRAP-TYPE and v2 NOTIFICATION-TYPE are the SNMP mechanism
for generating autonomous events to the SNMP manager. SNMP traps in
v1 are not defined as objects within the MIB tree. A TRAP-TYPE object
does not have a defined parent in the OBJECT IDENTIFIER format. Instead,
a trap definition specifies an enterprise for which a trap is defined.
The following is a typical TRAP-TYPE object:<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>bgpEstablished TRAP-TYPE ENTERPRISE bgp VARIABLES { bgpPeerRemoteAddr, bgpPeerLastError,
 bgpPeerState } DESCRIPTION "The BGP Established event is generated when the BGP FSM 
enters the ESTABLISHED state." ::= 1 </code></pre>
</div>
<p class="p">The <samp class="ph codeph">ENTERPRISE</samp> section
defines which object is the parent of the trap. However, it is possible
for a MIB tree object to be defined with <samp class="ph codeph">bgp</samp> as the
parent and it is defined as child number 1. In fact, <samp class="ph codeph">bgpVersion</samp> is
defined as <samp class="ph codeph">{ bgp 1}</samp> in the RFC1269-MIB module. Therefore,
it is impossible to add a v1 trap to the MIB tree as a leaf using
the <samp class="ph codeph">ENTERPRISE</samp> as the parent.</p>
<p class="p">SNMP v2 changes
the definition for TRAP-TYPE to NOTIFICATION-TYPE and specifies that
this new v2 trap be defined like other MIB objects, with a parent
and child number making this only a problem for v1 traps. RFC1155
Section 4.1 defines that using zero (0) as a child number is invalid,
and reserved for future use. SNMP v2 makes use of that zero by allowing
vendors to add their v1 traps to a v2 MIB, by adding a zero to the
enterprise name and then adding the trap number after the zero. Therefore,
under v2 it is appropriate to define an object identifier with a zero
as a child of the enterprise and then add the v1 traps as children
of that zero. </p>
<p class="p">This convention has caused another common mistake
made by MIB authors. Section 4 of RFC1155 states the following:</p>
<p class="p"><span class="q">"An
object type definition consists of five fields: OBJECT: ------- A
textual name, termed  the OBJECT DESCRIPTOR, for the object type,
along with its corresponding OBJECT IDENTIFIER.  Syntax: The abstract
syntax for the object type. This must resolve to an instance of the
ASN.1  type ObjectSyntax (defined below). Definition: A textual description
of the semantics of the  object type. Implementations should ensure
that their instance of the object fulfills this  definition since
this MIB is intended for use in multi-vendor environments. As such
it is  vital that objects have consistent meaning across all machines.
Access: One of read-only,  read-write, write-only, or not-accessible.
Status: One of mandatory, optional, or obsolete.  Future memos may
also specify other fields for the objects which they define."</span></p>
<div class="p">According
to this rule, all objects must have both an object name and an object
number. Some vendor's MIB modules, and even some RFCs, defined a NOTIFICATION-TYPE
with a parent of zero but without an object name for that zero. In
the following example, the object definition is not actually syntactically
correct as there is no object name defined for child number zero of
the <samp class="ph codeph">adslAtucTraps</samp> object. <span class="keyword">MIB Manager</span> recognizes the preference of some MIB authors to
use such methods as a shortcut, and allow the object to be added without
an object name. Additionally, to facilitate adding v1 traps to the
MIB tree, <span class="keyword">MIB Manager</span> automatically adds an object zero as a child of
the v1 enterprise object (note that a v1 MIB cannot use a zero in
its OID), assign that object zero as Traps where is the enterprise
name and add the trap below this new object in the MIB tree. For example,
using <samp class="ph codeph">bgp</samp> would result in the following traps ancestors: <samp class="ph codeph">{
bgp bgpTraps(0) 1 }).</samp> <pre class="pre codeblock"><code>adslAtucPerfLofsThreshTrap NOTIFICATION-TYPE OBJECTS { adslAtucPerfCurr15MinLofs, 
adslAtucThresh15MinLofs } STATUS current DESCRIPTION "Loss of Framing 15-minute 
interval threshold reached." ::= { adslAtucTraps 0 1 } </code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Varbinds</h2><p class="p">Objects that are transmitted with
the v1 trap or v2 notification are known as varbinds. Varbinds contain
additional information about the reported event. In a v1 trap, the
varbinds are itemized in the VARIABLES section and in a v2 notification
the varbinds are listed in the OBJECTS section. They have the same
use in all versions of SNMP. The order in which the varbinds appear
in the list is important because the PDU (SNMP Packet) encodes the
associated values in the same order in which they are listed in the
MIB.</p>
<p class="p">For example, in the OBJECTS section the following three
varbinds have been specified: <samp class="ph codeph">ifIndex</samp>, <samp class="ph codeph">ifAdminStatus</samp>,
and <samp class="ph codeph">ifOperStatus</samp>. Therefore, <samp class="ph codeph">ifIndex</samp> is
the first varbind to be encoded, <samp class="ph codeph">ifAdminStatus</samp> is
the second, and <samp class="ph codeph">ifOperStatus</samp> is encoded third. Checking
the IF-MIB we find that the <samp class="ph codeph">ifIndex</samp> object type is
defined as <samp class="ph codeph">InterfaceIndex</samp>. Since this is not a valid
primitive ASN.1 type for SNMP, it must be a textual convention. Searching
through the textual conventions, we find that <samp class="ph codeph">InterfaceIndex</samp> actually
resolves to an Integer32 (32 bit integer). Therefore, when the PDU
arrives at <span class="keyword">MIB Manager</span>, the first varbind will be an integer. To determine
what that integer means, <span class="keyword">MIB Manager</span> must reference the IF-MIB module, look up <samp class="ph codeph">ifIndex</samp>,
and read the associated object information. Checking the second varbind,
we find an enumerated integer type: </p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>SYNTAX INTEGER { up(1), -- ready to pass packets down(2), 
testing(3) -- in some test mode }</code></pre>
<p class="p">When the varbind is
decoded from the SNMP packet, its value will be an integer, the value
of which must be interpreted based on the items in this enumerated
list. When <span class="keyword">MIB Manager</span> is used to create a rules file, it will create a
lookup table to automatically link the enumerated integer with its
textual representation. The third varbind is also an enumerated type
with the same values. Therefore, if the <samp class="ph codeph">ifAdminStatus</samp> is
1 (up) and the <samp class="ph codeph">ifOperStatus</samp> is 2 (down), we know
why the event was generated and can proceed to attempt to determine
the cause of this outage.</p>
<p class="p">Varbinds are presented to the user
in a rulesfile as <samp class="ph codeph">$1</samp>, <samp class="ph codeph">$2</samp>, <samp class="ph codeph">$3</samp>,
and so on, with each number representing a varbind number. <span class="keyword">MIB Manager</span> creates elements based on the varbind elements and
uses these to set variables in the details table. For example, the
elements used in the details table might be $ifIndex = $1, which will
be an integer, $ifAdminStatus = $2, which will be something like up
(1), and $ifOperStatus = $3, which will be something like down (3).
Any changes made to the object settings are automatically set in the
rules file, using the conventions set by the Netcool Knowledge Library
(NCKL).</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Tables</h2><p class="p">Tables represent the equivalent of
a multidimensional array with rows and columns of data. The table
object is defined as a SEQUENCE OF an Entry object. The Entry object
is then defined as a SEQUENCE of OBJECT-TYPE objects. Occasionally,
a vendor designs an unusual system, for example the Cisco 10k router.
This device maintains an internal table of alarm conditions and generates
a trap or notification when the table changes. You must then issue
an SNMP GET request on the contents of the table to determine the
current status of the active alarms on the device. This makes obtaining
the alarms by the SNMP manager a bit more difficult, but not impossible
if the administrator has the tools to comply.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">OCTET STRING</h2><p class="p">An octet is a data construct
consisting of eight bits (commonly known as a byte). An OCTET STRING
then, is an array of bytes (or a string of bytes). The term OCTET
STRING does not imply that all of the bytes in the string are alphanumeric.
They can also be binary characters and are used as bitmasks.</p>
