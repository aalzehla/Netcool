<h1 class="title topictitle1">MIB concepts and design</h1>
<div class="body refbody"><p class="shortdesc">All SNMP MIB modules that are defined for use by a specific
device comprise the MIB for that device. The term MIB is often used
to describe a single module definition but this is technically incorrect.
In fact, the MIB is the combination of all of the modules used for
managing a specific device, whether the device relates to hardware
or software. Therefore, the more precise name for each module defined
by a vendor, or in an RFC, is SNMP MIB module.</p>
<div class="section"><p class="p">All MIB modules are eventually extensions of the root
module. All released MIB modules, from individual vendors, extend
from the enterprises object defined in RFC1155-SMI. Therefore, all
SNMP agents must support RFC1155, and all MIB modules are extensions
of RFC1155.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="omn_ref_mib_mibconcepts__smi"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Structure of Management Information (SMI)</h2><p class="p">To
make the SNMP management information base (MIB) extensible, related
items are arranged into MIB modules that form a structured hierarchy.
Each MIB module is defined inside the following construct:</p>
<p class="p"><samp class="ph codeph">ModuleName
DEFINITIONS ::= BEGIN END</samp></p>
<p class="p">The <samp class="ph codeph">BEGIN</samp> and <samp class="ph codeph">END</samp> tags
in the module enable several modules to be defined within a single
text file. MIB compilers should be able to handle any number of modules
defined in a single file, but should not require it.</p>
<p class="p">There are
conventions for every defined object within the module. For example,
a module name must begin with an uppercase alphabetic character and
contain only letters, numbers, hyphens (-), or underscores (_). An
object name must start with a lowercase alphabetic character and must
only contain letters, numbers, hyphens, or underscores. Comments in
MIB modules are represented by two consecutive hyphens (--) and any
text following this symbol, on any line, can be ignored.</p>
<p class="p">The
modular, easily extensible design of MIBs makes them able to support
any new functionality or device by adding an additional module. When
a module is written as an extension of another module, it will include
an <samp class="ph codeph">IMPORTS</samp> section, located below the <samp class="ph codeph">DEFINITIONS</samp> line.
The <samp class="ph codeph">IMPORTS</samp> section defines the objects required
by modules higher in the MIB hierarchy and the modules in which they
in turn are defined.</p>
<div class="p">The following definition is from RFC1157
and indicates several objects which are imported from RFC1155. This
section can be viewed as analogous to the <samp class="ph codeph">include</samp> statement
in a programming language such as C or Perl, or in a Netcool rules
file. Additionally, in order to understand the objects in the current
MIB module (RFC1157-SNMP) you must also be aware of the objects in
the previous MIB module (RFC1155-SMI). <pre class="pre codeblock"><code>RFC1157-SNMP DEFINITIONS ::= BEGIN IMPORTS ObjectName, ObjectSyntax, NetworkAddress, 
IpAddress, TimeTicks FROM RFC1155-SMI;</code></pre>
</div>
<p class="p">Typographical
errors are easily made when specifying imported MIB names. For example,
RFC1212 might be referenced as a MIB module instead of the correct
name, RFC-1212. If parsing errors are highlighted by <span class="keyword">MIB Manager</span>, you must check the <samp class="ph codeph">IMPORTS</samp> section
to confirm that the MIB modules are correctly named. Some MIB modules
also contain an <samp class="ph codeph">EXPORTS</samp> section (which also ends
with a semicolon). This section informs the reader that the MIB author
expects other MIB modules to use the same specified objects. For our
purposes, this section is irrelevant and can be ignored.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="omn_ref_mib_mibconcepts__def_data"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Defined data types</h2><p class="p">SNMP MIB
modules are defined in a format known as ASN.13 (Abstract Syntax Notation
1). SNMP, however, only uses a portion of ASN.14. ASN.1 is defined
in ITU-T X.208 and in ISO 8824. The portions of ASN.1 that apply to
SNMP are defined in RFC1155. RFC1155 defines the following valid SNMP
data types:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Primitive types: INTEGER, OCTET STRING, OBJECT IDENTIFIER, NULL</li>
<li class="li">Constructor types: SEQUENCE, SEQUENCE OF</li>
<li class="li">Defined types: NetworkAddress, IpAddress, Counter, Gauge, TimeTicks,
Opaque</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">A defined type is the mechanism used to specify a particular
format for primitive or constructor types. MIB authors can define
additional types using the TEXTUAL-CONVENTION construct.</p>
<div class="p"><samp class="ph codeph">DisplayString</samp> is
a good example of a defined type. In the SNMPv2-SMI-v1 MIB module,
the v1 version of <samp class="ph codeph">DisplayString</samp> has the following
definition:<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>DisplayString ::= OCTET STRING (0..255)</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="p">In
the SNMPv2-TC MIB module, the v2 version of <samp class="ph codeph">DisplayString</samp> has
the following definition: <pre class="pre codeblock"><code>DisplayString ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION DISPLAY-HINT "255a" STATUS current DESCRIPTION 
"Represents textual information taken from the NVT ASCII character set, as defined 
in pages 4, 10-11 of RFC 854. To summarize RFC 854, the NVT ASCII repertoire 
specifies: - the use of character codes 0-127 (decimal) - the graphics characters 
(32-126) are interpreted as US ASCII - NUL, LF, CR, BEL, BS, HT, VT and FF have the 
special meanings specified in RFC 854 - the other 25 codes have no standard 
interpretation - the sequence 'CR LF' means newline - the sequence 'CR NUL' means 
carriage-return - an 'LF' not preceded by a 'CR' means moving to the same column on 
the next line. - the sequence 'CR x' for any x other than LF or NUL is illegal. 
(Note that this also means that a string may end with either 'CR LF' or 'CR NUL', 
but not with CR.) Any object defined using this syntax may not exceed 255 characters
 in length." SYNTAX OCTET STRING (SIZE (0..255))</code></pre>
The example
above shows that a <samp class="ph codeph">DisplayString</samp> is an OCTET STRING
of 0 to 255 characters in length. Note that each OBJECT DESCRIPTOR
that corresponds to an object type in an internet-standard MIB must
be a unique, mnemonic, printable string.</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="omn_ref_mib_mibconcepts__def_objects"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Defining objects</h2><p class="p">A common
mistake made when writing MIB modules is to create an object name
that is not unique. It is claimed that the RFC1155 statement means
that only objects within a single MIB module must be unique. As previously
discussed, the MIB is the complete set of modules which, when combined,
are used to manage a particular device. Therefore, all objects defined
in any MIB module must be unique, not only in its own module, but
also in any other object name in any imported modules, and any modules
that those modules may import. A common mechanism for ensuring that
object names are unique is to pre-pend all module names with the company's
ticker symbol or abbreviated company name.</p>
<p class="p">When objects are
defined they are mapped into a numerical hierarchy which resembles
a spanning tree. Each time an object is defined, it is defined as
a leaf of a parent object. The following three root objects are defined
in the SNMP MIB tree:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><samp class="ph codeph">ccitt</samp> (root node zero)</li>
<li class="li"><samp class="ph codeph">iso</samp> (root node 1)</li>
<li class="li"><samp class="ph codeph">joint-iso-ccitt</samp> (root node 2)</li>
</ul>
<div class="p">All other nodes in the MIB tree are children of one of these
three root nodes. For example, RFC1155-SMI defines the following objects: <pre class="pre codeblock"><code>internet OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { iso org(3) dod(6) 1 } directory OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::=
 { internet 1 } mgmt OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { internet 2 } experimental OBJECT IDENTIFIER
 ::= { internet 3 } private OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { internet 4 } enterprises OBJECT 
IDENTIFIER ::= { private 1 }</code></pre>
</div>
<p class="p">These definitions indicate
the object name, the associated object types, each object's parent
name (or ordered list of parents), and the leaf number of this child
to that parent (or parents). Graphically, these items take on a hierarchical
form.</p>
<p class="p">You move through the <span class="keyword wintitle">MIB tree</span> view
by expanding and collapsing nodes within the MIB tree. The top level
branches of the MIB tree contain the names of the MIB modules, and
contained within each MIB module branch are the other elements which
comprise the MIB. As additional modules are added to the MIB, additional
objects are added to the MIB tree. Each object can be referred to
either by its object name or by its object identifier (OID). The most
accurate method is to refer to its OID. Its OID is defined as its
number, and each of its ancestor's numbers continuing back to the
root node, concatenated together with a period (.) separating each.
The OID for the enterprises object (node or leaf) is 1.3.6.1.4.1.</p>
<p class="p">Many
vendors do not ensure that their object names are universally unique,
therefore it is possible for two vendors to have an object sharing
the same name. This makes the use of the object name to identify an
object a little ambiguous.</p>
