<h1 class="title topictitle1">Monitoring accelerated events</h1>
<div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc"><span class="keyword">Tivoli Netcool/OMNIbus</span> can
handle millions of events a day, with all events being treated with
equal importance. However, operators might have key systems or events
that have tightly-controlled latency requirements. To accommodate
such requirements, the Accelerated Event Notification (AEN) application
provides a means of accelerating high-priority events to help ensure
that systems can continue to run without interruption.</p>
<p class="p">To configure accelerated event notification, system administrators
define conditions that identify key events for acceleration, and use
channels to propagate these events to specific recipients for action.
A channel defines which type (or columns) of event data to broadcast
for accelerated events, and the recipients (typically operators) of
this data.</p>
<p class="p">Recipients of the accelerated event data manage the events from
the Accelerated Event Notification client. All events that are identified
for acceleration are directly sent to the client as pop-up notifications.
These notifications contain event data that maps to the columns defined
for the channel that is currently in use. </p>
<p class="p">Recipients can additionally configure settings for the pop-up notifications,
and can click across to the desktop event list or the <span class="keyword">Web GUI</span> Active
Event List to obtain full details for the event and manage the event.</p>
<div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Prerequisites:</span> <ul class="ul"><li class="li">The Accelerated Event Notification client must be installed in
order to receive accelerated event notifications, and you must have

where the associated events are managed.</li>
<li class="link ulchildlink"><span class="ulchildlinktext"><a href="omn_aen_viewinghistoricalinfo.html">Viewing historical information for accelerated events</a></span><br />
Inbound notifications for accelerated events are maintained
within a history buffer. You can view this information within the
