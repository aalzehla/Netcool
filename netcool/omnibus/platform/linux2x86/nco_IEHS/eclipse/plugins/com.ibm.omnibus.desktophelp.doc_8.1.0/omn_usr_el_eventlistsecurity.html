<div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">All <span class="keyword">Tivoli Netcool/OMNIbus</span> users
belong to one or more user <dfn class="term">groups</dfn>. Each group is assigned
one or more <dfn class="term">roles</dfn>, which determine the permissions for
that group. The desktop tools that a user can access and the tasks
that a user can perform with the desktop tools depend on the group
to which the user belongs and the roles that are assigned to the group.</p>
<p class="p">The Normal, Administrator, and System groups provide group row
level security in the event list. 
The <span class="keyword parmname parmname">AlertSecurityModel</span> ObjectServer property
determines whether group row level security is enforced in the event
list.</p>
<p class="p">By default, the <span class="keyword parmname parmname">AlertSecurityModel</span> property
is disabled, and group row level security is not enforced. In this
case:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">A member of the Normal group can modify a row that is assigned
to themselves or the <samp class="ph tt">nobody</samp> user. When an alert is received
from the ObjectServer, the alert is assigned by default to the <samp class="ph tt">nobody</samp> user.</li>
<li class="li">A member of the Administrator group can modify a row that is assigned
to themselves, the <samp class="ph tt">nobody</samp> user, or a member of the Normal
group.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">If the <span class="keyword parmname parmname">AlertSecurityModel</span> property is enabled,
only users in the group that owns the row can modify the row. In this
case, a member of the Normal or Administrator group can modify a row
that is assigned to a group of which they are a member.</p>
<p class="p">A member of the System group can always modify any row.</p>
