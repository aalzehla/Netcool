<h1 class="title topictitle1">Desktop ObjectServer architecture</h1>
<div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">You can use a desktop ObjectServer architecture to improve
the performance of an ObjectServer that frequently experiences heavy
loads. </p>
<p class="p">The desktop ObjectServer architecture:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Reduces the workload of the central ObjectServer by shifting the
load to specialized desktop ObjectServers</li>
<li class="li">Improves desktop responsiveness; that is, the time between a desktop
operator's action and its reflection in the desktop GUI</li>
<li class="li">Reduces the likelihood of the desktop GUI freezing</li>
<li class="li">Improves the end-to-end latency times in heavily-loaded, standard
ObjectServer configurations</li>
<li class="li">Maintains high data integrity and consistency by simultaneously
updating the master ObjectServer</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">The desktop ObjectServer architecture consists of a master ObjectServer
and one or more desktop ObjectServers that share the duties normally
performed by a single ObjectServer. Dual server desktops (DSDs) connect
to a single, master ObjectServer when writing data, but read and display
alert data from desktop ObjectServers. The main functionality of the
DSD is the same as a standard desktop; for operators, the DSD behaves
identically to a standard desktop.</p>
<p class="p">The desktop ObjectServer architecture is shown in the following
figure.</p>
<div class="fig fignone"><span class="figcap">Figure 1. Example
dual server desktop architecture</span><div class="image"><img class="image" src="cd_omn_adm_dualserverdesktop.gif" alt="This figure shows a master ObjectServer that uses two unidirectional gateways to forward event data to two desktop ObjectServers. IDUC connections are used to send the event data to two dual server desktops, which in turn use SQL connections to write data to the master ObjectServer." /></div></div>
<p class="p">The DSD connects simultaneously to the desktop ObjectServer and
the master ObjectServer. Any operator actions (for example, tools
or journal actions) that are performed in the DSD are sent directly
to the master ObjectServer through a one-way SQL connection.</p>
<p class="p">Alerts in the master ObjectServer are sent to the DSD through the
desktop ObjectServer. This is achieved by using a unidirectional ObjectServer
Gateway from the master ObjectServer to the desktop ObjectServer,
and an IDUC connection from the desktop ObjectServer to the DSD.</p>
<p class="p">If dual-write mode is enabled, updates are also sent to the desktop
ObjectServer through another one-way SQL connection, as shown in the
following figure. </p>
<div class="fig fignone"><span class="figcap">Figure 2. Example
dual server desktop architecture with dual-write mode enabled</span><div class="image"><img class="image" src="cd_omn_adm_dsddualwrite.gif" alt="This figure shows the dual server desktop architecture with dual-write mode enabled." /></div></div>
