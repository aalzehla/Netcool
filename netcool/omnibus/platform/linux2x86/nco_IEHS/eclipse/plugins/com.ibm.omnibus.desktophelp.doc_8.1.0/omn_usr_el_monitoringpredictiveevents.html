<div class="body taskbody"><div class="abstract"><span class="shortdesc">A predictive event represents a prediction of
an impending threshold violation. These events differ from other events

</div>
<div class="section context"><div class="tasklabel"><h2 class="sectiontitle tasklabel">About this task</h2></div><p class="p">Predictive events are generated within <span class="keyword">IBM Tivoli Monitoring</span> based
on linear trending of historical data. You can monitor predictive
events from the <span class="keyword">Tivoli Netcool/OMNIbus</span> event
list if your system is configured to support this feature.  If
configured also, a <span class="ph uicontrol">Predictions</span> monitor box
will be available in the <span class="keyword wintitle">Event List</span> monitor box
window, and a <span class="ph uicontrol">Predictions</span> filter and <span class="ph uicontrol">Predictions</span> view
will be available in your event lists. <span class="ph">The <span class="ph uicontrol">Predictions</span> view
contains the following default columns, which are displayed as follows,
from left to right: Node, TrendDirection, Summary, FirstOccurrence,
LastOccurrence, Count, PredictionTime.</span></p>
<div class="p">The sort priority and sort order of the columns
is as follows:<ol class="ol"><li class="li">Severity in descending order</li>
<li class="li">LastOccurrence in ascending order</li>
<li class="li">PredictionTime in ascending order</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="p">When
your event list shows both actual and predictive events, you can use
the <span class="ph uicontrol">Predictions</span> filter and <span class="ph uicontrol">Predictions</span> view
to filter and sort predictive events. You can also identify predictive
events as follows:<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Check the text in the <span class="ph uicontrol">Summary</span> column. The
summary text is typically in one of the following formats (the severity
of critical predictive events is always 5, the severity of warning
predictive events is always 3):<ul class="ul"><li class="li">For linear trending events:<p class="p"><samp class="ph systemoutput">Predicted event rate
on <var class="keyword varname">Node</var> will hit threshold within <var class="keyword varname">PredictionTime</var> days.</samp></p>
</li>
<li class="li">For baselining events:<p class="p"><samp class="ph systemoutput"><var class="keyword varname">EventType</var> event
rate baseline situation has fired for node <var class="keyword varname">Node</var>,
the event count is <var class="keyword varname">EventCount</var> for node <var class="keyword varname">situation_name</var>.</samp></p>
</li>
<li class="li">For predictive events:<p class="p"><samp class="ph systemoutput">Critical threshold for <var class="keyword varname">resource</var> on <var class="keyword varname">Node</var> will
be breached in <var class="keyword varname">PredictionTime</var> day(s). (Situation: <var class="keyword varname">situation_name</var>).</samp></p>
<p class="p"><samp class="ph systemoutput">Warning
threshold for <var class="keyword varname">resource</var> on <var class="keyword varname">Node</var> will
be breached in <var class="keyword varname">PredictionTime</var> day(s). (Situation: <var class="keyword varname">situation_name</var>).</samp></p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="li">If you have a <span class="ph uicontrol">Class</span> column in your current
view, check the text in this column. By default, the entry is <samp class="ph systemoutput">Predictive
Events</samp>, although this value can be changed by your
system administrator.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p class="p">From the event list, you can perform the following operations
on predictive events:</p>
</div>
<div class="tasklabel"><h2 class="sectiontitle tasklabel">Procedure</h2></div><ul class="ul steps-unordered"><li class="li step stepexpand"><span class="ph cmd">Determine the confidence level of the predictions. To display
predictive events that meet a certain prediction confidence level: </span> <ol class="ol substeps"><li class="li substep"><span class="ph cmd">Right-click any event in the event list, and then click <span class="ph uicontrol">Show
Prediction Confidence</span> from the pop-up menu.</span></li>
<li class="li substep"><span class="ph cmd">From the <span class="keyword wintitle">Internal Command Parameters</span> window,
specify a percentage value between 0 and 100 only, in the <span class="ph uicontrol">Minimal
Confidence percentage</span> field.</span> The prediction
confidence indicates how accurate the approximated trended value is,
where 0 is no confidence and 100 is a perfect approximation. The default
is 50.</li>
<li class="li substep"><span class="ph cmd">Click <span class="ph uicontrol">OK</span>.</span> A
separate event list opens displaying predictive events with the specified,
or higher, confidence level. This event list shows all the fields
in the Default view. You can additionally double-click any event to
view its complete set of details in the <span class="keyword wintitle">Event Information</span> window.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li class="li step stepexpand"><span class="ph cmd">List all predictive events and actual events (if available)
that originated from the host for which a prediction was made. You
can use the results displayed to help you identify a possible cause
for the prediction trend towards a warning or critical threshold. </span> <p class="p">To display the events, right-click the predictive
event that you want to investigate, and then click <span class="ph uicontrol">Show
Predictive Events Threshold</span> from the pop-up menu. A separate
event list opens showing all events that are on the same host as the
selected predictive event, and which occurred from the time the prediction
was made, to the time the prediction is calculated to occur. (The
Default view is applied to this event list.) </p>
<p class="p">You can double-click
each event to view its complete set of details in the <span class="keyword wintitle">Event
Information</span> window.</p>
