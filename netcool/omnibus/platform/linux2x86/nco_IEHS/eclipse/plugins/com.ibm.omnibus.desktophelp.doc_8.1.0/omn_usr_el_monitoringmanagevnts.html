<div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">You can use the event list to monitor and manage alerts.
An alert is created when the ObjectServer receives an event, alarm,
message, or data item. Each alert is made up of columns (or fields)
of information that are held in a row in the ObjectServer alerts.status
table.</p>
<p class="p">The alert information that is displayed in the event list is determined
with the use of filters and views. <dfn class="term">Filters</dfn> enable you
to display a subset of alerts based on specific criteria. <dfn class="term">Views</dfn> enable
you to choose which alert fields to display. </p>

<li class="link ulchildlink"><span class="ulchildlinktext"><a href="omn_usr_el_startingeventlist.html">Starting the event list</a></span><br />
To monitor and manage alerts in the event list, you must
connect to a running ObjectServer by using valid authentication credentials.
You can start the event list from the Conductor, from the command
line, or from the Windows <span class="ph uicontrol">Start</span> menu.</li>
<li class="link ulchildlink"><span class="ulchildlinktext"><a href="omn_usr_el_managingevents.html">Managing events using the event list</a></span><br />

<li class="link ulchildlink"><span class="ulchildlinktext"><a href="omn_usr_el_performingcollectiveacts.html">Performing collective actions on event lists</a></span><br />
On the <span class="keyword wintitle">Event List</span> monitor box window,
each monitor box represents an event list containing events that match
a specific configuration of filters and views. You can access each
event list separately and manage the events. You can also perform
a number of collective actions on all of the event lists.</li>
<li class="link ulchildlink"><span class="ulchildlinktext"><a href="omn_usr_el_workingwithevntlstconfigs.html">Working with event list configurations</a></span><br />
You can save the filter, view, and other event configurations that
are defined for all the monitor boxes on the <span class="keyword wintitle">Event List</span> monitor
box window. This information is saved within an event list configuration (<span class="ph filepath">.elc</span>)
file. </li>

<span class="keyword">IBM Tivoli Composite Application
Manager for Internet Service Monitoring</span> works
in conjunction with the rest of the <span class="keyword">Tivoli Netcool/OMNIbus</span> product
suite. Events generated by both monitors and probes can be forwarded to the
same ObjectServer and you can manipulate these events using the same desktop. </li>

<span class="ph">A service-affected event (SAE) is an
alert that warns operators that a critical customer service has been
affected by one or more network events. Service-affected events are

IP Edition</span>.</span></li>
<li class="link ulchildlink"><span class="ulchildlinktext"><a href="omn_usr_el_monitoringpredictiveevents.html">Monitoring predictive events in the event list</a></span><br />
A predictive event represents a prediction of
an impending threshold violation. These events differ from other events
that are forwarded to <span class="keyword">Tivoli Netcool/OMNIbus</span> because
they represent an occurrence, fault, or situation that has not yet
occurred, but which has a significant probability of occurring in
the near future. </li>

<span class="keyword">TADDM</span> events
are generated within <span class="keyword">IBM
Tivoli Application Dependency Discovery Manager</span> when
a configuration change is detected in your IT environment. You can
monitor <span class="keyword">TADDM</span> events
from the <span class="keyword">Tivoli Netcool/OMNIbus</span> event

<li class="link ulchildlink"><span class="ulchildlinktext"><a href="omn_usr_el_identifyrootcauseevent.html">Identifying root cause events in the event list</a></span><br />
In a virtualized environment, <span class="keyword">Tivoli Netcool/OMNIbus</span> can correlate events to determine which events are the
root cause of other, symptom events. In the event list, you can identify
the root cause event behind symptom events if this feature is enabled
on your system.</li>
