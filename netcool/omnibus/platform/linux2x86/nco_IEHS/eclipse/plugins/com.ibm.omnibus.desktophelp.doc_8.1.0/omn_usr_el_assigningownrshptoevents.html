<div class="body taskbody"><p class="shortdesc">When an event arrives from a probe, the event is owned
by the <samp class="ph tt">nobody</samp> user unless ownership of the event has been
assigned to a specific user. Users with appropriate privileges can
take ownership of events throughout the problem lifecycle, or assign
events to a specific user or group.</p>
<div class="section context"><div class="tasklabel"><h2 class="sectiontitle tasklabel">About this task</h2></div><p class="p">The OwnerUID and OwnerGID columns provide this capability
to work as an individual or as a member of a team. (The OwnerUID column
holds the <span class="keyword">Tivoli Netcool/OMNIbus</span> user
ID of the owner of the event, and the OwnerGID column holds the group
ID.)</p>
<p class="p">As soon as an event is owned by a user, only that person
or a user with higher privileges can modify the event. If an event
is assigned to a group, the OwnerUID is reassigned to the <samp class="ph tt">nobody</samp> user.
After an event is assigned to a group, only a member of that group
or a user with higher privileges can modify the event. </p>
<div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> The users or groups to which you can assign events depends
on your security permissions. If you are a normal user, you can assign
only the events assigned to you, your group, or the <samp class="ph tt">nobody</samp> user.</div>
