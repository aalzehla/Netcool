===============================================================================
This file contains changes to the triggers that configure the integration with 
the IBM Operations Analytics - Log Analysis product. The changes in this file 
are only for use with the Network Manager Insight Pack.

After you apply this file, the triggers prevent events from being forwarded to
IBM Operations Analytics - Log Analysis until the events are enriched by data
from the Network Manager product. (To enrich events, Network Manager populates
the NmosObjInst column of the ObjectServer alerts.status table during event
processing; the Insight Pack requires that the NmosObjInst column be populated.)
A publish trigger runs every 5 seconds. If the events are not enriched 20 seconds
after the trigger has run, the events are forwarded to IBM Operations 
Analytics - Log Analysis without NmosObjInst data.

The triggers have been modified in fixpack 5 to send re-inserted rows as updates.
This allows the insight pack to differentiate between new events and modifications
to existing events and prevents double counting of modified events in reports.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

You can apply the file using the nco_sql utility on UNIX or the isql utility on 
Windows, for example:

$OMNIHOME/bin/nco_sql -user userid -root password < $OMNIHOME/extensions/scala/scala_configuration_itnm.sql


NOTE: 

The file must be applied to version 8.1 fixpack 2 and above of the ObjectServer
only. If you are upgrading from a 7.4 release ObjectServer you must run the
update74fp3to81.sql script before this file.
If you are upgrading to 8.1 fixpack 5, you must re-run the file below to apply the
latest version of the triggers. Warnings about duplicated objects can be ignored in this case.
