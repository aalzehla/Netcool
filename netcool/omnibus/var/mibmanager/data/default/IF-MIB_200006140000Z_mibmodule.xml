            that this name contain one or more of the following: ASCII
            form of the manager station's transport address, management
            station name (e.g., domain name), network management
            personnel's name, location, or phone number.  In some cases
            the agent itself will be the owner of an entry.  In these
            cases, this string shall be set to a string starting with

<DESCRIPTION>This textual convention is an extension of the
            InterfaceIndex convention.  The latter defines a greater
            than zero value used to identify an interface or interface
            sub-layer in the managed system.  This extension permits the
            additional value of zero.  the value zero is object-specific
            and must therefore be defined as part of the description of
            any object which uses this syntax.  Examples of the usage of
            zero might include situations where interface was unknown,
            or when none or all interfaces need to be referenced.</DESCRIPTION>

<DESCRIPTION>This object is an 'alias' name for the interface as
            specified by a network manager, and provides a non-volatile
            'handle' for the interface.

            On the first instantiation of an interface, the value of
            ifAlias associated with that interface is the zero-length
            string.  As and when a value is written into an instance of
            ifAlias through a network management set operation, then the
            agent must retain the supplied value in the ifAlias instance
            associated with the same interface for as long as that
            interface remains instantiated, including across all re-
            initializations/reboots of the network management system,
            including those which result in a change of the interface's
            ifIndex value.

            An example of the value which a network manager might store
            in this object for a WAN interface is the (Telco's) circuit
            number/identifier of the interface.

            Some agents may support write-access only for interfaces
            having particular values of ifType.  An agent which supports
            write access to this object is required to keep the value in
            non-volatile storage, but it may limit the length of new
            values depending on how much storage is already occupied by
            the current values for other interfaces.</DESCRIPTION>

            example, when the sub-layer with ifIndex value x runs over
            the sub-layer with ifIndex value y, then this table
            contains:

              ifStackStatus.x.y=active

            For each ifIndex value, I, which identifies an active

            object is likely to be inappropriate for some types of

<DESCRIPTION>This table contains one entry per interface.  It defines
            objects which allow a network manager to instruct an agent
            to test an interface for various faults.  Tests for an
            interface are defined in the media-specific MIB for that
            interface.  After invoking a test, the object ifTestResult
            can be read to determine the outcome.  If an agent can not
            perform the test, ifTestResult is set to so indicate.  The
            object ifTestCode can be used to provide further test-
            specific or interface-specific (or even enterprise-specific)
            information concerning the outcome of the test.  Only one
            test can be in progress on each interface at any one time.
            If one test is in progress when another test is invoked, the
            second test is rejected.  Some agents may reject a test when
            a prior test is active on another interface.

            Before starting a test, a manager-station must first obtain
            'ownership' of the entry in the ifTestTable for the
            interface to be tested.  This is accomplished with the
            ifTestId and ifTestStatus objects as follows:

          try_again:
              get (ifTestId, ifTestStatus)
              while (ifTestStatus != notInUse)
                  /*
                   * Loop while a test is running or some other
                   * manager is configuring a test.
                   */
                  short delay
                  get (ifTestId, ifTestStatus)
              }

              /*
               * Is not being used right now -- let's compete
               * to see who gets it.
               */
              lock_value = ifTestId

              if ( set(ifTestId = lock_value, ifTestStatus = inUse,
                       ifTestOwner = 'my-IP-address') == FAILURE)
                  /*
                   * Another manager got the ifTestEntry -- go
                   * try again
                   */
                  goto try_again;

              /*
               * I have the lock
               */
              set up any test parameters.

              /*
               * This starts the test
               */
              set(ifTestType = test_to_run);

              wait for test completion by polling ifTestResult

              when test completes, agent sets ifTestResult
                   agent also sets ifTestStatus = 'notInUse'

              retrieve any additional test results, and ifTestId

              if (ifTestId == lock_value+1) results are valid

            A manager station first retrieves the value of the
            appropriate ifTestId and ifTestStatus objects, periodically
            repeating the retrieval if necessary, until the value of
            ifTestStatus is 'notInUse'.  The manager station then tries
            to set the same ifTestId object to the value it just
            retrieved, the same ifTestStatus object to 'inUse', and the
            corresponding ifTestOwner object to a value indicating
            itself.  If the set operation succeeds then the manager has
            obtained ownership of the ifTestEntry, and the value of the
            ifTestId object is incremented by the agent (per the
            semantics of TestAndIncr).  Failure of the set operation
            indicates that some other manager has obtained ownership of
            the ifTestEntry.

            Once ownership is obtained, any test parameters can be
            setup, and then the test is initiated by setting ifTestType.
            On completion of the test, the agent sets ifTestStatus to
            'notInUse'.  Once this occurs, the manager can retrieve the
            results.  In the (rare) event that the invocation of tests
            by two network managers were to overlap, then there would be
            a possibility that the first test's results might be
            overwritten by the second test's results prior to the first
            results being read.  This unlikely circumstance can be
            detected by a network manager retrieving ifTestId at the
            same time as retrieving the test results, and ensuring that
            the results are for the desired request.

            If ifTestType is not set within an abnormally long period of
            time after ownership is obtained, the agent should time-out
            the manager, and reset the value of the ifTestStatus object
            back to 'notInUse'.  It is suggested that this time-out
            period be 5 minutes.

            In general, a management station must not retransmit a
            request to invoke a test for which it does not receive a
            response; instead, it properly inspects an agent's MIB to
            determine if the invocation was successful.  Only if the
            invocation was unsuccessful, is the invocation request
            retransmitted.

            Some tests may require the interface to be taken off-line in
            order to execute them, or may even require the agent to
            reboot after completion of the test.  In these
            circumstances, communication with the management station
            invoking the test may be lost until after completion of the
            test.  An agent is not required to support such tests.
            However, if such tests are supported, then the agent should
            make every effort to transmit a response to the request
            which invoked the test prior to losing communication.  When
            the agent is restored to normal service, the results of the
            test are properly made available in the appropriate objects.
            Note that this requires that the ifIndex value assigned to
            an interface must be unchanged even if the test causes a
            reboot.  An agent must reject any test for which it cannot,
            perhaps due to resource constraints, make available at least
            the minimum amount of information after that test
            completes.</DESCRIPTION>

<DESCRIPTION>A control variable used to start and stop operator-
            initiated interface tests.  Most OBJECT IDENTIFIER values
            assigned to tests are defined elsewhere, in association with
            specific types of interface.  However, this document assigns
            a value for a full-duplex loopback test, and defines the
            special meanings of the subject identifier:

                noTest  OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { 0 0 }

            When the value noTest is written to this object, no action
            is taken unless a test is in progress, in which case the
            test is aborted.  Writing any other value to this object is
            only valid when no test is currently in progress, in which
            case the indicated test is initiated.

            When read, this object always returns the most recent value
            that ifTestType was set to.  If it has not been set since
            the last initialization of the network management subsystem
            on the agent, a value of noTest is returned.</DESCRIPTION>

<DESCRIPTION>This object contains a code which contains more specific
            information on the test result, for example an error-code
            after a failed test.  Error codes and other values this
            object may take are specific to the type of interface and/or
            test.  The value may have the semantics of either the
            AutonomousType or InstancePointer textual conventions as
            defined in RFC 2579.  The identifier:

                testCodeUnknown  OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { 0 0 }

            is defined for use if no additional result code is
            available.</DESCRIPTION>
